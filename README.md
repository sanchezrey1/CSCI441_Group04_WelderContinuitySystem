Welder Qualification & Continuity Management System

This repository contains the group project for CSCI 441 – Software Engineering at Fort Hays State University.

The goal of this project is to design and develop a system that tracks welder qualifications and continuity records, automatically identifying qualifications that are current, nearing expiration, or expired. The system aims to reduce manual tracking effort and help prevent compliance issues by providing clear status visibility and alerts.
