## How to Run the Project

You need **two terminals open at the same time** — one for the backend, one for the frontend.

### Terminal 1 — Backend
```bash
# From the project root
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn backend.login:app --reload --port 8000
```
Backend will be running at `http://localhost:8000`

### Terminal 2 — Frontend
```bash
# From the project root
npm install
npm run dev
```
Frontend will be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or 5174 — check your terminal output)

### First Time Setup — Create a Test User
1. Open `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your browser
2. Click **POST /register → Try it out**
3. Enter and execute:
```json
{
  "email": "admin@test.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```
You can now log in with those credentials on the frontend.

## Dashboard Module (Kimsean)

### What it does
The dashboard is the first screen after login. It shows:
- **Compliant / At Risk / Expired** counts as stat tiles
- **Donut chart** of overall compliance distribution
- **Action Needed** cards — every welder with an expiring or expired qualification, sorted by urgency

### API Endpoint
```
GET /api/dashboard
```
Returns:
```json
{
  "compliant_count": 10,
  "at_risk_count": 3,
  "expired_count": 2,
  "total_welders": 15,
  "chart_data": [...],
  "action_needed": [
    {
      "welder_id": 15,
      "name": "Victor Nguyen",
      "employee_id": "E015",
      "department": "Pipeline",
      "status": "EXPIRED",
      "expiration_date": "2026-03-23",
      "process_name": "SAW",
      "code_name": "AWS D1.1",
      "days_until_expiry": -7
    }
  ]
}
```

### Status Logic
| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| `expiration_date > today + 30 days` | IN_STATUS (Compliant) |
| `expiration_date <= today + 30 days` | AT_RISK |
| `expiration_date <= today` | EXPIRED |

### Demo Data
On first run, `dashboard.py` automatically seeds the database with 15 demo welders and qualifications so the dashboard has data to display. To reset, delete `db/myapp.db` and restart the backend.

## Notes for Each Teammate

### La Aries (Auth)
- The dashboard currently has **no auth guard** on `/api/dashboard`
- Once auth is stable, add `user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)` as a parameter to the `get_dashboard()` function in `dashboard.py`
- Login flow is already wired up in `App.jsx` — after login, the JWT token is saved to `localStorage` and the dashboard loads automatically

### Reyes (Warnings / Qualifications)
- The `action_needed` list in the dashboard already surfaces AT_RISK and EXPIRED records
- Warnings module can read from the same `qualifications` and `notifications` tables — no duplicate data needed
- Any new qualifications you insert will automatically appear on the dashboard on next refresh

### Rachel (Welder Records)
4/23/2026 - added basic functionality for Add Welder, more edits to come
- Dashboard reads from `welders`, `qualifications`, `processes`, and `codes` tables using the shared `db/myapp.db`
- Make sure new welders are inserted with `employment_status = 'Active'` — the dashboard filters out inactive welders
- The demo seed data in `dashboard.py` uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` so it won't conflict with real records you add
